# Pickster with React + Vite & Firebase
-	Users can select a genre from a list and have a random movie generated
-	If they like the movie they can see which streaming providers have it for either rent, purchase or subscription
-	If they donâ€™t like it, they can roll the dice again for the same genre selection or head back to the main page and change the genre selection
- When a user is logged in they can add a movie to their watch later list

## Plans
-	Provider/Subscription Preferences (e.g only generate movies available on netflix)
-	Link to streaming service (TMDB has no deep links so thinking about what to do)

## Libraries & Frameworks
- Tailwind CSS
- React Icons
- Axios

## API
- The Movie Database (TMDB)
